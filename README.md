# valheim_ashen_mods
A collection of Unity mods written for the game Valheim from Iron Games Studio.

These are the mods you will find inside this collection:
* EpicTitles

## EpicTitles

This mod uses some player metric in order to set titles to players. For instance, it divides the Skill range (0-100), so to give a title for each level of skill:
* "10 Wood Cutting" = "Novice Lumberjack"
* "30 Axes" = "Journeyman Axeman"
* ...

Moreover it adds the support to exchange Skills updates between players and server, so to have **skill rank up notification** to other players and also a **ladder system**, accessible through commands in the in-game console.

More metric will be handled by the mods in the future, like deaths, kills and others.
